## Notice
All my code is based on this project:
Comprehensive Study on GPU Program Numerical Issues
https://github.com/GPU-Program-Bug-Study/Comprehensive-Study-on-GPU-Program-Numerical-Issues.github.io/tree/main

This project has a complete pipeline with generation, compilation, and execution. However, I only need the CUDA program generation at the moment, so I have cut it down.

Though I am a beginner, I may add some new features in the future.
